- This section is for minimal install on debian.

** Installation
   - Get Debian ISO file, both standard or minimal is fine.
   - For laptop, use (wired) LAN, not WLAN.
   - At first screen, do not press Installation directly, but
     install by: Advaced options - expert install
   - Everything is as-is, but watch for these options:
     disable root user, preinstall desktop environment.
   - After installation, log in using non-root but user in sudoer
     group.

** Before installing packages
   - sudo is automatically installed if root user is disabled, if
     not so, reinstall.
   - Check for update using: $ sudo apt update
   - Edit file /etc/network/interfaces: comment out every line
     except on interface lo.
   - Install network-manager using: $ sudo apt install network-manager
   - Purge modem-manager using: $ sudo apt purge modemmanager
   - Finally disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service by using:
     $ sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service

** Installing packages
   - Before anything, get backed up files by using bnr.sh, and to do so
     install most basic packages using script (type 0).
   - Press a for installing everything by using script. Script uses
     package_list.txt for package list, so add if you need one.
   - Install additional packages thats not on apt:
     1. bluetuith (https://github.com/bluetuith-org/bluetuith)
	Its for cli bluetooth management. Need package golang & bluez,
	and after installation, execute
	echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
	to add bluetuith at PATH.
     2. ncpmaxer (https://github.com/fulhax/ncpamixer)
	Its for cli volume management. Need package:
	libpulse-dev, libncurses-dev, cmake, pulseaudio.
	also need to add line pulseaudio --start at .xinitrc, and move
	compiled exec to /usr/bin/.

** Getting configurations
   - Use installed stow and create_stow.sh to put settings needed,
     remove some if you does not need them.
